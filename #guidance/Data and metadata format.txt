Guidance on correct format for data and metadata can be found on the SDGs wiki page. See below for some relevant links.

If a commit / pull request is rejected, ensure that all of the mandatory fields in the metadata are present, and that
the CSV conforms to the rules below ('Year' and 'Value' column; no whitespace; no empty rows; forbidden characters removed).
Forbidden characters include apostrophes, colons, and accented letters (á, é, í, ó, ú).
The 'GeoCode' column should be one space to the left of the 'Value' column, which is always the rightmost column. 'Year' on the left.

If the data is not show on the tool after a pull request, make sure that the metadata field 'reporting status' = 'complete'.

Finally, when checking for whitespace in Excel, you can use and drag the following formula (example for cell A1).
=if(or(left(A1,1)=" ",(right(A1,1)=" ")),"Whitespace","")

Troubleshooting

If the Travis build goes red, or takes more than 10 minutes to complete, there has been a problem.
Open build by going to 'Details' in the Pull Request, or going to travis-ci.org.

Select the repository you are using (sdg-data or sdg-indicators), click one of the 'Build jobs',
and then scroll down to the bottom of the text output to determine the cause of the problem.
Often, a CSV or metadata field has failed the checks, and you will need to fix that file before the build can finish.
This is a case of doing another commit with the updated file, either manually or with Git Bash.

Search (CTRL + F) for the word 'error' or 'fail' - this will often be near the bottom.
There should be text explaining which file caused the error, and why. Common errors can include...


"data/indicator_17-8-1.csv : Trailing whitespace in column:  Location"
Cause: 17.8.1 CSV file has whitespace somewhere in the 'Location' column - remove it.

"found duplicate key "data_non_statistical" with value "False" in "meta/3-1-1.md""
Cause: 3.1.1 metadata file has two fields called 'data_non_statistical' - delete one.

"found duplicate key "graph_title" with value "Maternal mortality ratio (MMR) in "meta/3-1-1.md""
Cause: 3.1.1 metadata file has two fields called 'graph_title' - delete one.

"Checking 244 metadata files...
"graph_title missing for published statistical indicator in meta/2-2-2.md"
Cause: 2.2.2 metadata file is missing the 'graph_title' field - add it.
Note: It can be useful to look at a completed indicator from ONS DIGITAL repo, or to
update the metadata through the 'Edit' button on the site to help add a missing field.

"data/indicator_5-5-1.csv : Empty row on rows:  [2]"
Cause: 5.5.1 CSV is missing a row - find and amend it (try the bottom of the CSV)

"data/indicator_17-6-2.csv 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xe9 in position 9: unexpected end of data"
Cause: 17.6.2 CSV has a forbidden character (á, é, í, ó, ú, ü, ñ, etc.) - replace it
