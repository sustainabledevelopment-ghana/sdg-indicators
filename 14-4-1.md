graph_title: 'Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels'
graph_type: line
indicator: 14.4.1
indicator_definition: The indicator Proportion of fish stocks within biologically
  sustainable levels measures the sustainability of the world's marine capture fisheries
  by their abundance. A fish stock of which abundance is at or greater than the level,
  that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is classified as biologically
  sustainable. In contrast, when abundance falls below the MSY level, the stock is
  considered biologically unsustainable.
indicator_name: Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels
national_indicator_available: Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels
national_indicator_definition: >- 
  This indicator measures the sustainbility of the world's marine capture fisheries by the abundance. The fish stock of which abundance is at or graeter than the level that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY is classified as biological sustainable level. in contrast, when then abundance falls below the MSY level, the stock is considered biologically unsustainable.
national_indicator_description: >- 
  The indicator measures the sustainability of fish resources based on two major considerations: yield and reproduction. When a stock is fished biologically sustainable, it produces good yield without impairing the stock's reproductivity, reaching a good balance between human use and ecological conservation. The proportion is just calculated based on stock numbers, without weighting either by its production volume or stock abundance, that is every fish stock is considered of the same importance.
computation_calculations: 1) Fishery sustainability is defined based on stock abundance. To know stock abundance, one needs to carry out stock assessment that uses fish catch statistics, fishing effort data and biological information. 2. The data is fitted into a population dynamics model. After completing stock assessment for all stocks concerned, fish stocks that have abundance at or above the level associated with the maximum sustainable yield are counted as biologically sustainable, and otherwise are considered as overfished.

target: By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported
  and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based
  management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible,
  at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their
