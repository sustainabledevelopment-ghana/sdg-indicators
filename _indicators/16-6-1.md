national_indicator_available: Primary governement expenditure as a proportion of approved budget
national_indicator_definition: >- 
  Primary government expenditures as a proportion of original approved budget. This indicator measures the extent to which aggregate budget expenditure outturn reflects the amount originally approved, as defined in government budget documentation and fiscal reports. The coverage is budgetary central government (BCG) and the time period covered is the last three completed fiscal years.
national_indicator_description: >- 
  Aggregate expenditure includes actual expenditures incorporating those incurred as a result of unplanned or exceptional events—for example, armed conflicts or natural disasters. Expenditures financed by windfall revenues, including privatization, should be included and noted in the supporting fiscal tables and narrative. Expenditures financed externally by loans or grants should be included, if covered by the budget, along with contingency vote(s) and interest on debt
computation_calculations: The methodology for calculating this indicator is provided in a spreadsheet (titled “En PI-1 and PI-2 Exp Calculation-Feb 1 2016 (xls)”) on the PEFA website (http://www.pefa.org/en/content/pefa-2016framework). It is also detailed in part 2 of the document “Framework for assessing public financial management” (https://www.pefa.org/sites/pefa.org/files/attachments/PEFA%20Framework_English.pdf).  Scoring is at the heart of the indicator. A country is scored separately on a four-point ordinal scale: A, B, C, or D, according to precise criteria:  (A) Aggregate expenditure outturn was between 95% and 105% of the approved aggregate budgeted expenditure in at least two of the last three years. (B) Aggregate expenditure outturn was between 90% and 110% of the approved aggregate budgeted expenditure in at least two of the last three years. (C Aggregate expenditure outturn was between 85% and 115% of the approved aggregate budgeted expenditure in at least two of the last three years. (D) Performance is less than required for a C score
