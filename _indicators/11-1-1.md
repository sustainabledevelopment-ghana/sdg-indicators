  Proportion of people living in households lacking at least one of the following five housing conditions: access to improved water; access to improved sanitation facilities; sufficient-living area (not overcrowded); durable housing; and security of tenure. The following criteria are used to determine the access to improved water: Piped connection to house or plot, Bottle water (new), Protected spring, Rain water collection, and Protected dug well. Access to improved sanitation: A household is considered to have access to improved sanitation according to the following criteria: Direct connection to public sewer, Direct connection to septic tank, Ventilated improved pit latrine (KVIP), and flush latrine in the dwelling. A dwelling unit is considered to provide a sufficient living area for the household members if there are fewer than four people per habitable room. A house is considered as ‘durable’ if it has a structure permanent and adequate enough to protect its inhabitants from the extremes of climatic conditions (with durable material for Outer wall, roofing and floor). Secure Tenure is the right of all individuals and groups to effective protection by the State against arbitrary unlawful evictions.
