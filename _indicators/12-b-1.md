We have not explored suitable data sources for this indicator.

This, or part of this, indicator is classified as Tier 3 and therefore no internationally established methodology or standards are yet available, but methodology or standards are being (or will be) developed or tested.

The Sustainable Development Goals Secretariat is a collaborative project. If you have any feedback or suggestions for data, please contact us at: sdg.secretariat@statsghana.gov.gh
