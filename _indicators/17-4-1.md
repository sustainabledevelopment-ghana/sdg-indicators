This indicator is being used as an approximation of the United Nations SDG indicator as it is more relevant to the national context.

The national metadata is still being developed in collaboration with the relevant Ministry, Department or Agency.  We will continue to work with these institutions over the next few weeks to update this information.

The Sustainable Development Goals Secretariat is a collaborative project. If you have any feedback or suggestions for data, please contact us at: sdg.secretariat@statsghana.gov.gh

**Footnote** Please note that the debt service data used in computing this indicator excludes principal payments. In other words, interest payments was used as proxy for the calculation.
