indicator: 3.2.2
indicator_definition: Probability that a child born in a specific year or period will
  die during the first 28 completed days of life if subject to age-specific mortality
  rates of that period, expressed per 1000 live births. Neonatal deaths (deaths among
  live births during the first 28 completed days of life) may be subdivided into early
  neonatal deaths, occurring during the first 7 days of life, and late neonatal deaths,
  occurring after the 7th day but before the 28th completed day of life.

The national metadata is still being developed in collaboration with the relevant Ministry, Department or Agency.  We will continue to work with these institutions over the next few weeks to update this information.

The Sustainable Development Goals Secretariat is a collaborative project. If you have any feedback or suggestions in relation to data, please contact us at: sdg.secretariat@statsghana.gov.gh
