national_indicator_available: Proportion of population that has convenient access to public transport
national_indicator_definition: This indicator will be monitored by the proportion of the population that has convenient access to public  transport. Access to public transport is considered convenoient when an officially recognised stop is accessible within a distance of 0.5km from a reference point such as home, school, work place, market, etc. Additional criteria for defining public transport that is convenient include (a) public transport accessible to all special-needs customers, including those who are physically, visually, and /or hearing-impaired, as well as those with temporally dissabilities, the elderly, children and other people in vulnerable situations.

computation_calculations: But generally, public transport stops offer a more appropriate basis than route for estimating service area coverage because stops are the actual loacations where public transport user access the system. the othe decision involved in the buffering operation is the buffer size. A common practice in public transport planing is to assume that people are served by public transport if they are within 0.5 km (or 500m) of either a public transport route or stop. Once a distance treshold is defined, buffers are created around the public transport features. the population with access to public transport out of the entire city population would be computed as ; percentage with access to public transport is equal to 100 X (population with convenient access to public transport) / (city population )The identification of the population served: once a service buffer is constraucted, the next step is to overlay the buffer onto the polygons, such as census tracts, for which socio-demographic data ( such as population figures, disabled persons, type of reseidence area, etc.is available. These polygons are referd to as the analysis zones. Typically, a service buffer (denoted as i) intersect, either fully or partially, with more than one analysis zone j( j=1.......J). The population served by the public transport service in buffer i, Pi, is thus equal to the sum of population in each of the intersecting areas, pij. Hence Pi = ?_(j=1) J|Pij Where, Pij is estimated based on the amount of interaction between service buffer i and analysis zone j. In estimating Pij it is assumed that the population is uniformly distributed within the analysis zones.

target: By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport
  systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with
  special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children,
