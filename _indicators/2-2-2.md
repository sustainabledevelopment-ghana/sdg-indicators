   Prevalence of wasting (weight for height <-2 standard deviations from the median of the World Health Organization (WHO) Child Growth Standards) among children under 5 years. The weight for height index measure body mass in relation to body height and describes current nutritional status. Children whose weight for height Z-scores are below -2 standard deviation (SD) from the median of the reference population are considered wasted (thin) or acutely malnourished.

computation_definitions: >-
  Height-for-age is a measure of linear growth. A child who is below -2 Standard Deviations (SD) from the reference median for height-for-age is considered short for his or her age, or stunted, which is a condition reflecting the cumulative effect of chronic malnutrition.
computation_calculations: >-
  Number of children age 0-59 months who are stunted divided by total number of children age 0-59 months who are measured and multiplied by 100

  internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years
  of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating
  women and older persons.
