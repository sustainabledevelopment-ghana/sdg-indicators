national_indicator_available: Age-specific fertility rate (per 1000 girls aged 15â€“19 years)
national_indicator_description: >-
  Adolescent birth rate or adolescent fertility rate is the number of births per thousand girls aged 15-19 years. These rates are presented for the three-year period preceding the survey. 
  A three-year period (rather than a longer or a shorter period) was chosen to calculate rates as a balanced response to provide the most current information, reducing sampling error, 
  and avoiding problems caused by the displacement of births.
