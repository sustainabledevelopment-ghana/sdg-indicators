The national metadata is still being developed in collaboration with the relevant Ministry, District or Authority.  We will continue work with these colleagues over the next few weeks to update this information.

The Sustainable Development Goals Secretariat is a collaborative project, if you have any feedback or suggestions for data please contact us at: sdg.secretariat@statsghana.gov.gh
