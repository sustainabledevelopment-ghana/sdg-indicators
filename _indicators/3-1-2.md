 This indicator measures the proportion of deliveries attended by health personnel trained in providing lifesaving obstetric care, including giving the necessary supervision, care and advice to women during pregnancy, labour and the post-partum period, conducting deliveries on their own, and caring for newborns. Traditional birth attendants, even if they receive a short training course, are not included. A maternity is a pregnancy resulting in the birth of one or more children including stillbirths. A stillbirth is a baby born after 24 or more weeks completed gestation and which did not, at any time, breathe or show signs of life.

  There has been an increase in the number of births attended by skilled health
  personnel between 2003 and 2014. Motherâ€™s with higher levels of education and
  income levels are more likely to be attended to by skilled health providers
  during child birth. The percentage of births attended to by skilled health
  providers did not vary significantly with age.
