Delivery assistance for all live births in the preceding five years by a doctor, midwife, nurse or community health nurse. Percentage of births attended by skilled health personnel (generally doctors, nurses or midwives) is the percentage of deliveries attended by health personnel trained in providing lifesaving obstetric care, including giving the necessary supervision, care and advice to women during pregnancy, labour and the post-partum period, conducting deliveries on their own, and caring for new-borns. Traditional birth attendants, even if they receive a short training course, are not included.
