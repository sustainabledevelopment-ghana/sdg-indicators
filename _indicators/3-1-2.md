computation_definitions: >-
  Percentage of births attended by skilled health personnel (generally doctors,
  nurses or midwives) is the percentage of deliveries attended by health
  personnel trained in providing lifesaving obstetric care, including giving the
  necessary supervision, care and advice to women during pregnancy, labour and
  the post-partum period, conducting deliveries on their own, and caring for
  new-borns. Traditional birth attendants, even if they receive a short training
  course, are not included.

  There has been an increase in the number of births attended by skilled health
  personnel between 2003 and 2014. Motherâ€™s with higher levels of education and
  income levels are more likely to be attended to by skilled health providers
  during child birth. The percentage of births attended to by skilled health
  providers did not vary significantly with age.
