  Post Harvest Loss is the quantitative losses in storage, transport, harvest and marketing of agricultural  produce incurred after harvest. Percentage of total production that is lost (quantitative and qualitative) during all stages of the post-harvest phases of the system for priority products. For the purpose of this report, post-haverst losses (PHL) are restricted to the losses that occur during harvesting, storage, transport, processing, packaging and sales.

  Note: Figures available are estimates. No Post-Harvest Survey has been conducted over the past 20 years. However a survey is to be  conducted in the  year 2019. So the current data are based on projections.

This indicator is being used as an approximation of the United Nations SDG indicator as it is more relevant to the national context.

This, or part of this indicator is classified as Tier 3 and, therefore, no internationally established methodology or standards are yet available, but methodology or standards are being developed or tested.

The national metadata is still being developed in collaboration with the relevant Ministry, Department or Agency. We will continue to work with these institutions over the next few weeks to update the information.

The Sustainable Development Goals Secretariat is a collaborative project. If you have any feedback or suggestions for data, please contact us at: sdg.secretariat@statsghana.gov.gh
