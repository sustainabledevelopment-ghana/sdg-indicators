This indicator is being used as an approximation of the United Nations SDG indicator as it is more relevant to the national context.

This, or part of this indicator is classified as Tier 3 and, therefore, no internationally established methodology or standards are yet available, but methodology or standards are being developed or tested.

The national metadata is still being developed in collaboration with the relevant Ministry, Department or Agency. We will continue to work with these institutions over the next few weeks to update the information.

The Sustainable Development Goals Secretariat is a collaborative project. If you have any feedback or suggestions for data, please contact us at: sdg.secretariat@statsghana.gov.gh
