This, or part of this, indicator is classified as Tier 3 and therefore no internationally established methodology or standards are yet available, but methodology or standards will be developed or tested.

We are currently corresponding with topic experts at the relevant Ministry, Department and Agency to acquire data for this indicator as detailed in the SDG Indicator Baseline Report.

The Sustainable Development Goals Secretariat is a collaborative project. If you have any feedback or suggestions for data, please contact us at: sdg.secretariat@statsghana.gov.gh
