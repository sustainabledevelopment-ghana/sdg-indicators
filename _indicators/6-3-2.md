This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator, as it more relevant to the national context.

This, or part of this, indicator is classified as Tier 3 and therefore no internationally established methodology or standards are yet 
available, but methodology or standards are being (or will be) developed or tested.

The Sustainable Development Goals Secretariat is a collaborative project, if you have any feedback or suggestions for data please contact us at: sdg.secretariat@statsghana.gov.gh
