  PM2.5 measurements can directly be linked to estimates of health risks using an integrated exposure response function, and are therefore of particular interest. PM10 measurements first need to be converted to PM2.5 in order to do. In high-income countries, PM2.5 measurements are already being widely performed. In low- and middle-income countries, however, while PM2.5 measures are increasingly being developed, they are not yet available in many countries. In low-and middle-income countries, annual mean PM2.5 measurements could be accessed in 69 cities, but PM10 in 512 cities. In high-income countries, 816 cities with PM2.5 measures could be accessed, against 544 cities with PM10 measurements.
computation_calculations: >-
  The sum of average monthly levels of particulate matter recorded for each identified locations (permanent sites and roadside).

This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator, as it is more relevant to the national context.

The national metadata is still being developed in collaboration with the relevant Ministry, Department or Agency. We will continue to work with these institutions over the next few weeks to update this information.

The Sustainable Development Goals Secretariat is a collaborative project. If you have any feedback or suggestions for data, please contact us at: sdg.secretariat@statsghana.gov.gh
