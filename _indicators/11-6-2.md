graph_title: 'Annual mean levels of fine particulate matter, Greater Accra'
graph_type: bar
indicator: 11.6.2
indicator_name: Annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (e.g. PM2.5 and PM10)
  in cities (population weighted)

national_indicator_available: Annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (PM10) in Accra (μg/m3)
national_indicator_description: >-
  The mean annual concentration of fine suspended particles of less than 10 microns in diameters (PM10)
unit_measure: 1) Number of people(in thousands)/metric tonnes (in thousands)
computation_units: number
national_geographical_coverage: Greater Accra
computation_definitions: >-
  The fresh quartz filter paper was weighed before sampling. After the 24-hour sampling period, post sampling filters were weighed and the difference in weight (W2-W1) was used to calculate the concentrations of the particulate matter in µg/m3 using the formula below.
computation_calculations: >-
  This indicator is calculated as (PM10 & TSP (µg/m3)  = Net dust weight * 106 / Flow rate (L/Min) * Sampling time (Min))

This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator, as it is more relevant to the national context.

The national metadata is still being developed in collaboration with the relevant Ministry, Department or Agency. We will continue to work with these institutions over the next few weeks to update this information.

The Sustainable Development Goals Secretariat is a collaborative project. If you have any feedback or suggestions for data, please contact us at: sdg.secretariat@statsghana.gov.gh
