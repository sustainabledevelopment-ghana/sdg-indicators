The national metadata is still being developed in collaboration with the relevant Ministry, Department and Authority.  We will continue to work with these colleagues over the next few weeks to update this information.

The Sustainable Development Goals Secretariat is a collaborative project, if you have any feedback or suggestions for data please contact us at: sdg.secretariat@statsghana.gov.gh
