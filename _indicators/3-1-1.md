  1) Institutional maternal mortality number of maternal deaths occurring in health facilities per 100, 000 live births.  the estimate from survey represents on maternal deaths occurrences recorded at health facilities and other per 100,000 live births. 
  2) Maternal mortality ratio (from survey) is the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. Maternal deaths are any deaths that occurs during pregnancy or childbirth or within 42 days after the birth of a child or termination of pregnancy. Maternal deaths do not include deaths due to accidents or violence.
computation_calculations: >-
 (1) Maternal deaths of women 15-49 years occuring in health facilities during the period divided by Women 15-49 years who were pregnant and visited health facilities and multiplied by 100,000 live births. (2) Maternal mortality ratio is calculated by dividing the age- standardised maternal mortality rate for women age 15-49 in the 7 years preceding the survey by the general fertility rate (GFR) for the same period.

national_indicator_description: >-
  The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is defined as the number of maternal deaths
  during a given time period per 100,000 live births during the same time
  period. It depicts the risk of maternal death relative to the number of live
  births and essentially captures the risk of death in a single pregnancy or a
  single live birth. Maternal deaths: The annual number of female deaths from
  any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding
  accidental or incidental causes) during pregnancy and childbirth or within 42
  days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the
  pregnancy, expressed per 100,000 live births, for a specified time period.
