  The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is defined as the number of maternal deaths
  during a given time period per 100,000 live births during the same time
  period. It depicts the risk of maternal death relative to the number of live
  births and essentially captures the risk of death in a single pregnancy or a
  single live birth. Maternal deaths: The annual number of female deaths from
  any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding
  accidental or incidental causes) during pregnancy and childbirth or within 42
  days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the
  pregnancy, expressed per 100,000 live births, for a specified time period.
