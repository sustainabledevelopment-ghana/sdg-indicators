computation_definitions: >-
 The proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services is the total population in households with drinking water from a safely managed source expressed as a percentage of the total population in households
computation_calculations: a) At the rural communities, the total number of public water points can be computed; as per design standards, each water point provides services to 300 people. Based on this, the total coverage in the community can be calculated. This is a supply side information gathering process. b) In urban areas, the total number of house connections will be taken from the records of the utility (GWCL). This will be multiplied by the standard household size for urban areas. In addition, the number of public stand-posts / kiosks will be multiplied by the standard criteria for public water points to arrive at the figure for population depending on them
