Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) is responsible for the development, collection and reporting of Ghana data for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) indicators, and for reporting Ghana’s progress in achieving them.

This National Reporting Platform (NRP) is for disseminating Ghana SDG data. The data on the NRP is user-friendly as it is presented in open, transparent, and re-usable formats. 

The NRP is still at an Alpha stage in development. As a result, it is still ‘work in progress’. 

GSS is working in collaboration with the Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and other stakeholders within the National Statistical System (NSS) to produce data for the SDGs.

This NRP is also linked to the GSS website which can be accessed at **[statsghana.gov.gh](http://statsghana.gov.gh/SDGs_main.html)**
If you have any feedback on this National Reporting Platform or Ghana SDG data, then kindly contact us at [sdg.secretariat@statsghana.gov.gh]
